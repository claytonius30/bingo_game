1.	What is the purpose and benefits of the application or system

I will create a Bingo game that I can serve as a web application. The purpose is to allow a facilitator who is hosting a bingo night/tournament to use the webapp to connect with players’ devices. The players’ devices will act as their virtual bingo cards that they can interact with by selecting the called bingo numbers. The players’ interaction is visible to the facilitator on their device, who is in charge of keeping track of the winner(s). The app will also have the option for the facilitator to play against other simulated, or real players who join their group online through the app.

2.	Who are the anticipated users

Anticipated users would be anyone seeking to host a bingo event using an online platform; also, for anyone wanting to play a virtual bingo game online with other real or simulated players.

3.	What type of application is it (desktop, web, mobile, web service, other)

This will be a web application.

4.	What components or subprojects do you anticipate to build (web api, JavaScript)

I will be using Java on the backend to handle the logic of the game while interacting with JavaScript, HTML and CSS on the client-side. For communication between the front-end and back-end I will use Axios to make HTTP requests.

5.	What technologies are you considering for inclusion? This could change moving forward to draft 1.

I am envisioning using Canvas with JavaScript to provide visual representation of an interactive bingo card. One possibility is Vue Konva, which is a JavaScript library that allows drawing Canvas graphics using Vue.
